                    image: lalama1982/posts:0.0.2
    (d) Inside the "k8s", execute "kubectl apply -f posts-depl.yaml".
        >> Response should be: deployment.apps/posts-depl configured
        >> Checking the pods
            kubectl get pods

        image: lalama1982/posts
        image: lalama1982/posts:latest
