1. Apply the deployment config file using the following
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v0.40.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
    (a) Resources
        -   https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx
        -   https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/
        
    Note: Seems course instructions are out-dated. Simply follow the instructions given.

2. Under "infra\k8s", create "ingress-srv.yaml"
    - Apply the file : kubectl apply -f ingress-srv.yaml

3. In the "ingress-srv.yaml" file, host is set as "host: posts.com"
    (a) When called, "posts.com", via a browser or as a call, it should not be directed to web but to the kube cluster
        - Open the "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" file.
        - After "# End of section" tag, add "127.0.0.1 posts.com"
        - This will essentially redirect the route to local host

    (b) Inside the "ingress-srv.yaml", "/posts" is mapped to posts service
        -   path: /posts
            backend:    
                serviceName: posts-clusterip-srv
                servicePort: 4000     

4. Testing
    (a) Creating a posts
        Call : [POST] - http://posts.com/posts
        Body :  [raw / json]
                {
                    "title": "Second Post"
                }
        Header : Content-Type / application/json

        Response :  {
                        "id": "bf389ef3",
                        "title": "Second Post"
                    }

    (b) Retrieving posts
        Call : [GET] - http://posts.com/posts
        
        Header : Content-Type / application/json

        Response :  {
                        "849c950b": {
                            "id": "849c950b",
                            "title": "First Post"
                        },
                        "bf389ef3": {
                            "id": "bf389ef3",
                            "title": "Second Post"
                        }
                    }
