(1) Not used in "PROD" envs

(2) Go to "skaffold.dev"

(3) In "Windows" you need "Chocolatey" installed
    At "cmd": @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command " [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
    At "powershell" :
        [Run "Get-ExecutionPolicy". If it returns "Restricted", 
            then run "Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned" or "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process."]
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

    Run "choco" & should return following;
        Chocolatey v0.10.15
        Please run 'choco -?' or 'choco <command> -?' for help menu.        

(4) Once the "Chocolatey" is successfully installed, install "skaffold" as following;
        - in cmd with Admin Privs
    choco install -y skaffold

    Run "skaffold version" & should return
        v1.16.0

(5) At root folder create "skaffold.yaml"

(6) At root folder terminal:
    enter "skaffold dev"

    Notes:
        Needed to run "skaffold dev" twice, to get the "posts.com" up
        On 2nd run, it will run as a server.
        Changes to a file will restart like "nodemon".

    Important:
        Each pod should have "nodemon", hence any change to pod it self will restart the pod.
        - "skaffold" will not do that.        

    Hit "ctrl+c" at terminal to stop "skaffold"
