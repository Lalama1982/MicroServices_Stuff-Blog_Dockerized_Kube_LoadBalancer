1) Inside, "posts" directory create a file without extension as "Dockerfile". (case sensitive)
2) Create another as ".dockerignore" to ignore files & folders been copied to docker image (i.e. "node_modules")
3) Go to termial prompt of "posts" & run "docker build ." (docker should be running in the PC)
    3.1) Once executed successfully, it will show the cotainer id.
        e.g. Successfully built 2e680b3d1dbb
    3.2) Go to console & run the container as "docker run 2e680b3d1dbb"
    3.3) This should start the service (like "npm start")

4) Following the below command, a build could be built with an image id & tag name
    docker build -t lalama1982/posts .
    [here "lalama1982" is the docker name] 

    With a version: docker build -t lalama1982/posts:0.0.1 .   

    Once executed at the end it show the image id & tag name
    e.g. Successfully built f6abc7e3f544
         Successfully tagged lalama1982/posts:latest

    So the service could be start using following commands.
    a) docker run 2e680b3d1dbb
    b) docker run lalama1982/posts:latest      

5) Since other services (i.e. "comments")  use same set of commands (npm start) to up the service, duplicating (with slight changes)
   docker config files to those folders will suffice
